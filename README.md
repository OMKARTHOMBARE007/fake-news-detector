\## 📌 Overview



With the rapid spread of misinformation and AI-generated media, verifying digital content has become increasingly important.  

\*\*TruthGuard AI\*\* addresses this challenge by providing automated detection mechanisms for:

\- Fake or misleading news articles

\- Manipulated or AI-generated images and videos (deepfakes)



The system integrates trained ML/DL models into a Flask-based application to deliver predictions in a simple and user-friendly manner.
